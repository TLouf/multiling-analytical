# Analystical study of agent-based models for language shift

This repo contains Mathematica code in notebooks used to perform an analysis of
the fixed points of agent-based models of language shift, and to generate the
associated plots, located in `figs/`.

`bi_pref_model` analyses the fixed points in mean field, and, for the model
introduced in our paper, determines the region of the parameter space where it
converges to stable coexistence of languages.

`metapop_analytical` analyses the fixed points of the models and their stability
in a toy meta-population consisting of only two populations.
